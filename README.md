# Craft CMS Starter Kit

An opinionated [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com) starter kit, featuring the following:

- Sass pre-processing
- ES6 compilation
- Cache bursting
- Composer managed
- AWS S3 asset management
- Git deploys to Heroku

## Installation

Firstly if you do not have it installed, go ahead and install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

Then clone this repository and navigate to it:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mikefrancis/craft-starter-kit.git
cd craft-starter-kit
```

Then start all the containers:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Make a note of the `web` container ID, execute bash and install the Composer dependencies:

```bash
docker exec -i {CONTAINER_ID} bash
composer install
```

Once this is complete you will then need to edit the generated `.env` file to add your project's URL and database and
S3 credentials.

After completing this step, the final thing to do is to run the database migrations:

```bash
php craft migrate
```

## Development

You can either view your project in the browser or run the following to start a new BrowserSync server:

```bash
npm run watch
```

This will watch your source files and perform your build tasks, then reload the browser for you. The server will proxy
to whatever is set as your `APP_URL` in your `.env` file.

## Deployment

When you're ready to share your project, you can deploy it to [Heroku](https://heroku.com) for free (at the time of writing).

First, create a new Heroku app and add the ClearDB add-on:

```bash
heroku create
heroku addons:create cleardb:ignite
heroku config:get CLEARDB_DATABASE_URL
```

From the `CLEARDB_DATABASE_URL`, you will need to extract the following:

```bash
mysql://{$USERNAME}:{$PASSWORD}@{$SERVER}.cleardb.net/{$DATABASE}?reconnect=true
```

And replace the values below with those values:

```bash
heroku config:set \
 APP_ENV=production \
 APP_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32) \
 DB_DRIVER=mysql \
 DB_HOSTNAME=SERVER.cleardb.net \
 DB_USERNAME=USERNAME \
 DB_PASSWORD=PASSWORD \
 DB_DATABASE=DATABASE
```

[(We are trying to find a way to automate this!)](https://github.com/mikefrancis/craft-starter-kit/issues/2)

Once these environment variables have been published to Heroku, you are ready to push your code. Heroku will then take
care of installing the dependencies and migrating the database:

```bash
git push heroku master
```

Then you can view your project!

```bash
heroku open
```

## Extending

As we're making use of the fantastic [Laravel Mix](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/mix) package, you can take advantage of other configurations and build
tasks enabled, such as:

- [Copying folders](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/mix#copying-files-and-directories) (if you are using custom fonts)
- [Compiling JSX templates](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/mix#react)

Please check the [docs](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/mix) for more!
